      <p>We are a grassroots startup in Texas looking to help get Marco Rubio elected as our next President of the United States. We are a part of the grassroots <a href="https://twitter.com/search?f=realtime&q=%23teammarco&src=typd" target="_blank">#TeamMarco</a> campaign on Twitter - follow us at <a href="http://twitter.com/texansforrubio" target="_blank">@texansforrubio</a> to keep up with the latest news. We’ll be working with other conservative grassroots organizations in Texas to setup meet-ups in the future so stay tuned. </p>

      <p>We love our Texas politicians and we know there are some great ones in this same race for 2016, but we really think that Rubio will have the best chance and do the best as our next President. We love his story and his enthusiasm for this country. We love his politics and the way he can articulate his position from the heart. We’ve been looking for someone who’s articulate and energetic for a long time and we’re happy we found that in Rubio.</p>
      <p>Our children deserve to inherit the greatest society in all of human history. The New American Century begins now. - Marco Rubio</p>

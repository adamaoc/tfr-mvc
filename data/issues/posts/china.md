The U.S.-China relationship holds enormous potential. But that potential will never be realized while President Xi insists on pursuing policies that increasingly threaten U.S. national security and prevent China’s citizens from fulfilling their potential.

President Obama seems to not understand this. As president, I will restore American strength and moral clarity in our relationship with China and convey American resolve on the issues facing the United States and China.

__How:__

* Restore American Strength to ensure the United States remains a Pacific power.

* Protect the American economy.

* We must stand on the side of freedom and human rights, both inside China and on its periphery

In our international economy, the ability to trade is greater than it has ever been, the ability of students to travel abroad and learn is greater than it has ever been, the ability to innovate through cooperation as well as competition is greater than it has ever been. China and America are the largest economies on earth. If our people are allowed to cooperate on their economic futures, it can only change the world for the better.

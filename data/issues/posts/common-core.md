On Day One, Marco will issue an executive order directing federal agencies to stop any and all activity related to implementing or encouraging Common Core.

Common Core has been used by the Obama administration to turn the Department of Education into a national school board. This effort to coerce states into adhering to national curriculum standards is not the best way to help our children attain the best education, and it must be stopped.

Empowering parents, local communities and the individual states is the best approach. After all, if parents are unhappy with a local or state school board’s decisions, they can go to their board and get it changed. No such option exists if decisions are being made about education in faraway Washington.

In the Senate, Marco has long raised concerns about Common Core:

He began raising concerns about federal coercion of the adoption of Common Core in 2011, called federal education governance — such as a mandate to adopt Common Core — unconstitutional, and sponsored legislation to prohibit federal coercion regarding Common Core and ensure that the Department of Education cannot impose standards or curriculum on states.

As President, Marco will stop the federal government from pushing Common Core on states and give states and localities control over education:

Marco will give states and local communities complete autonomy in education decision making and get rid of Washington bureaucrats who impose education standards and curriculum on our nation’s children. He will ensure no federal education funding is tied to mandates and prohibit the federal government from forcing states or local districts to adhere to principles or interfere in local education. He will issue an executive order directing federal agencies to stop all activity related to implementing or enforcing Common Core.

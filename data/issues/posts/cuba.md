The Obama administration’s new policy toward Cuba has been nothing more than unilateral concessions from the United States that will strengthen the brutal Castro regime and do nothing to help free the Cuban people.

The policy is based on the illusion that more commerce and access to money and goods will translate into political freedom for the Cuban people. This will not work: The Cuban people are not free because the regime — just as it does with every aspect of life — manipulates and controls to its own advantage all currency that flows into the island. More economic engagement with the U.S. means that the regime’s grip on power will be strengthened for decades to come, dashing the Cuban people’s hopes for freedom and democracy.

We need a reversal of the Obama administration’s irresponsible policy changes, and a new president that will promote freedom for the Cuban people and punish the Castro regime for its authoritarianism and cruelty.

Marco has a long record of standing up for the Cuban people. He has:

Highlighted the Suffering of the Cuban People and Democracy Activists by:

* Frequently meeting with democracy activists to call attention to their work and the Castro regime’s unceasing repression;

* Supporting the expansion of Internet access in Cuba and fighting to protect U.S. assistance to Cuban dissidents and civil society groups.

Opposed the Obama Administration’s New Cuba Policy by:

* Rejecting President Obama’s unilateral concessions to Cuba and pledged to oppose the confirmation of a U.S. ambassador without significant reforms in Cuba;

* Holding hearings to challenge the Obama administration’s lack of transparency and failure to uphold its promises about the deal’s claimed benefits;

* Sponsoring legislation to deny U.S. resources to Castro’s military and security services.

As President, Marco will:

Back Democracy and Human Rights in Cuba

* Provide unconditional support to Cuba’s pro-democracy movement, promote greater access to uncensored information for the Cuban people, and deprive the Castro regime of funding for its repressive security state.

Restore Cuba to the State Sponsor of Terrorism List

* Unless Cuba stops helping North Korea evade U.N. sanctions, harboring fugitives from American justice, and supporting designated Foreign Terrorist Organizations, it should be restored to the State Sponsor of Terrorism List.

End Diplomatic Relations with the Castro Regime and Modernize Sanctions

* Reverse President Obama’s attempts to normalize relations and condition any further lessening of sanctions until Cuba engages in meaningful political and human rights reform, returns U.S. fugitives, and agrees to honor American property claims and outstanding judgments;

* Modernize U.S. sanctions against Cuba to restore leverage and encourage true improvements in the lives of the Cuban people.
